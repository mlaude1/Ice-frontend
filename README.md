## Challenges

- Bulma troubles
  - some of it is easy. Like, quickly creating styled buttons and creating footers. It's really simple
  - other things are hard, like figuring out layouts (e.g. trying to get the layout of the ice cream cards in the index right)
  - use in combination with Sass. I still use Sass for specifics: unique colors, animations, force margins (unfamiliar with Bulma)
  - Bulma is wonderful for responsiveness though because it's powered by Flexbox
